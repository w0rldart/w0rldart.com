List of [git](https://git-scm.com/) tips and tricks that I compiled over time. Ping me if you have any others to share.

## How do I change the author of my commits?

Sometimes it happens that you commit from different computers with different [author and email configurations](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/).

If you prefer consistency, the following steps can help remedy that:

### Reset the git commits author

```shell
git filter-branch --commit-filter \
'export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Author Name"; \
export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=authoremail; \
export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="Committer Name"; \
export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=committeremail; \
git commit-tree "$@"'
```

### Push the changes to remote

```shell
git push -u -f origin --all
```

*   **-u** Most of commits will be out of sync after that change, so this is useful to refresh the association between local branches and remote
*   **-f** Force push
*   **--all** Push all branches

### Keep your clone in-sync

```shell
git fetch origin master
git reset --hard origin/master
```

E voil√†!

## How many lines of code do I have?

Reading "[How many lines of code is Facebook?](http://www.quora.com/Facebook-Engineering/How-many-lines-of-code-is-Facebook)" question, I found this git gem:

```shell
git ls-files | xargs cat | wc -l
```
